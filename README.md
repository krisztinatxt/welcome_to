## Test

All codes are validated and beatufied.

1. HTML Validator
- Unfortunatelly the HTML validator doesn't understand the Materialize dropdown menu structure, so I got a bunch of errors because of this saying that : `Element ul not allowed as child of element ul in this context.`
No other error found.
2. CSS
- Valid, no error found.
- Autoprefixer used.

- No syntax errors!
